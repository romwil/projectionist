"""Idle task: scan for release-date anniversaries and "watched on this day".

Finds library items whose release month+day matches today, producing
"On This Day" entries like "Released 10 years ago today."  Also detects
"You watched X exactly N months ago today."

Results are stored in a ``daily_anniversaries`` table, cleared and rebuilt
each run for the current date.

Default interval: 24 hours (run once daily).
