"""SQLite database for library index, chat, preferences, lenses, and embeddings.

This package is a behavior-preserving refactor of the former single-file
``projectionist/library/db.py``. The public surface is unchanged: ``Database`` and the
module-level constants/helpers are re-exported here, so existing imports such as
``from projectionist.library.db import Database, DEFAULT_LENS_ID`` continue to resolve.
The former one class is now composed from topic mixins (see the ``_*.py``
modules) purely for maintainability; method resolution is unaffected because
every method name is unique across the mixins.

from __future__ import annotations

# ``time`` is imported here so tests that patch ``projectionist.library.db.time.sleep``
# (the SQLite lock-retry backoff) keep working against the package.
