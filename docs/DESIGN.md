# Projectionist — Design Document

Product principles, single-workspace UX, lens isolation, agent behavior, and API design for the current Projectionist release. Items marked **Future** are planned but not fully shipped.

---

## Product principles

1. **Intent-aware, not averaged** — Taste lives in **curation lenses**, not one global profile. Casual watches must not poison curated study lanes.

2. **Chat-first** — The curator conversation is the primary loop. Settings, sync, title detail, and the owner dashboard support the chat.

3. **One workspace** — Full-width chat (~80% reading column) with a conversation sidebar and status dock. Optional overlay expands large title-card result sets.

4. **Explain the “why”** — Every title card carries a `recommendation_reason`.

5. **Sovereign identity** — Name your curator; tune persona sliders and switch personas per conversation without redeploying.

6. **Confirm before changing the fleet** — Radarr/Sonarr/Seerr mutations always require explicit confirmation.

7. **Bring your own provider** — LLM and embeddings are configurable; Ollama on the homelab is first-class.

8. **Homelab pragmatism** — Single container (non-root), SQLite, no mandatory cloud beyond TMDB and your chosen LLM.
9. **Safe browse and repair** — Library exports apply the same member privacy schema as browse results; media problems become durable reports for owner review rather than member-triggered *arr mutations.

## Browse exports and media issue repair

Library browse endpoints accept an explicit sort direction while retaining each field's established default when no direction is provided. CSV exports reuse those filters but are capped and privacy-sanitized before rows are serialized, so a household member cannot turn a convenient download into a path or Plex-token disclosure.

Reporting a bad title creates an issue-queue record. Members can report, but only owners can resolve or execute a repair. Safe repair playbooks identify an already-managed *arr title, optionally remove a known bad Radarr movie file, and enqueue the documented search command. When the title is not managed or its identity is incomplete, Projectionist records a skip reason rather than guessing an endpoint or deleting files.

### Shared browse interaction standard

`MediaBrowseControls` is the standard for a collection-sized result set: a visible sort plus `sort_dir`, filters that reflect the source's actual data, a poster/list pivot, durable column choices, and CSV only when the wall maps faithfully to the library query. `MediaBrowseResults` keeps poster and dense-row variants aligned. A list row must carry the same `PosterActionMenu` as its poster counterpart so accessibility, muscle memory, and role checks do not vary by layout.

`PosterActionMenu` is a bottom-corner grip rather than another set of always-visible poster buttons. Its sections follow user intent: view/play, collect (watchlist/list/playlist), discover, report, then owner tools. It is present on library posters and compact title cards where sensible. The control is not a privilege escalation: report is broadly available; repair and index changes remain owner-gated.

`ShareActionMenu` applies that same portaled-grip pattern to curator responses and saved library pages. An action first ensures a sanitized, account-scoped saved item exists, then acts on its authenticated `/library/:id` route. Copy, export, print/PDF, and system share are conveniences around that private route, never public-link issuance. Library list rows make the originating persona visible with an avatar/name badge and keep the one-to-two sentence persona-voiced summary subordinate to the owner's title.

### Repair safety model

The issue lifecycle is `open → approved/repairing → resolved` or `rejected`, with a durable append-only repair log from the user's point of view. The frontend may optimistically describe a submitted report as queued, but must never imply that it repaired media. Owner repair code must prefer “skipped because target is not safe/known” over a speculative *arr call. Auto-repair remains opt-in by issue code and is intentionally narrower than owner manual repair; no playbook performs a blind file delete, metadata rewrite, or bulk action.

---

## Visual language

Two complementary themes share layout and type; only color tokens swap via `html[data-theme]`:

| Theme | Preference value | Feel |
|-------|------------------|------|
| **Lights Down** | `lights_down` (default) | Cinema chamber — near-black surfaces, warm paper text |
| **Lights Up** | `lights_up` | Gallery paper — light surfaces, same amber accent discipline |
| **Match system** | `system` | Follows `prefers-color-scheme` |

Accent stays a single **amber/gold** (no blue→violet gradients). Display type (**Fraunces**) for brand and empty-state headlines; body UI (**DM Sans**). Atmosphere comes from subtle ambient washes (persona/context), not glow stacks or pill chrome. Toggle lives in the top bar (icon cycle) and **Settings → Profile**.

Quiet oval controls must remain discoverable: selectors use a `selectable-oval` token, a Material `expand_more` icon, and a token-backed hover/focus fill. New controls favor icon buttons with accessible labels/tooltips; their colors must use shared theme tokens so Lights Down and Lights Up stay equivalent.

| Token role | Intent |
|------------|--------|
| Surfaces | Layered `--bg` / `--surface` / `--surface-raised` per theme |
| Accent | Warm gold primary CTAs and focus |
| Type | Display for brand; body for chat and forms |
| Text size | Per-user preference (`small` / `medium` / `large`) via `--base-font-size` |

---

## Single workspace layout

Projectionist serves one React application (`frontend/src/App.jsx`) with a shared **AppShell** chrome on authenticated browse/detail routes:

| Region | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| **Hamburger AppNav** | Navigation drawer (☰) on chat and AppShell pages. **Navigate** repeats the top bar's role-gated peers as labelled links (Search, Chat, Explore, Inbox, Admin for owners, My Journey, Settings) from the shared `primaryNav.js` model; **More** adds Plot Lab, Tags, **Watchlist** (opens the `/watchlist` explore page), Library, Help, Privacy, About. On `/admin/*` an owner also gets an **Admin** block of section links between the two. |
| **Top bar** | Projectionist brand, curator name, agent pulse; **Plex server name** + movie/show counts; icon chrome for **Explore**, theme cycle, watchlist pins, Admin/Settings; optional streak chip; optional **UserMenu** when multi-user is on. No About link in the top bar. |
| **Sidebar** | Conversation list + New thread + **Watchlist (N)** button (→ `/watchlist`) + **status dock** (bottom of rail) |
| **Chat column** | Recommendations inbox (multi-user), welcome / On This Day / Library Glance / Quick Pick, thread with **AgentAvatar** + ambient context tag (⧉), title cards, composer with **PersonaSelector** + Surprise Me |
| **Explore** | Hub at `/explore` with children (Tags, Plot Lab, section pages) — cinema browse, not a second “app mode” |
| **Results overlay** | Optional horizontal expand for large card sets (“Cinema mode”) |
| **Footer** | Subtle **Privacy** and **About** links on all layouts (chat, Admin, Settings, Explore). **What’s New** may surface as a lightweight release modal (separate from AppNav). |

Leaf pages (title detail, person, tag, Explore section) keep **BackLink** *plus* AppShell — never BackLink instead of the shell.

### Visual state tokens

| Token | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `.agent-pulse` | **Chat** agent state only: idle / thinking / error (not library sync) |
| Ambient tint | Subtle background shift from **per-thread** conversation context + persona accent |
| Status dock | Operational sync / add progress — lives in the **sidebar**, not the chat column |
| Context label | Inferred topic (`context_label`) stored per thread; updates when switching conversations |

---

## Title cards & title detail

Inline and turnstyle cards share the same affordances:

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Click title / poster** | Navigate to `/title/{movie\|show}/{id}` — AppShell sticky header (AppNav + BackLink), backdrop hero, synopsis, meta tiles, cast/tags |
| **Watch trailer** | YouTube trailer modal when `trailer_youtube_key` is present |
| **Watch on Plex** | Shown when the title is in-library (`rating_key`); opens Plex deep link |
| **More Like This** | Horizontal neighbor carousel from cached `item_neighbors` (empty until idle `plot_neighbors` ran) |
| **Recommend** | Multi-user: pick household peers + optional note; unread inbox on home |
| **Pin (☆)** | Add/remove local watchlist pin |
| **Why this?** | Expand `recommendation_reason` / facet matches (also surfaced on detail) |
| **Add / Request** | Radarr, Sonarr, or Seerr via confirmation flow |
| **Not interested** | Preference dismiss signal |

Runtime under 100 minutes gets emphasis on the card. Show cards may display a TV progress ring.

In-library **TV show** title detail (full page and drawer) includes **Seasons & episodes**: accordion seasons with episode codes, runtime, size, and watched state from `library_episodes`. Owners can typed-`DELETE` confirm a season or episode (Sonarr files + Plex metadata + index), or remove the whole show through the existing delete dialog.

### Agent avatar

Assistant messages show a circular **AgentAvatar** (curator initial) beside the bubble. Streaming state adds a subtle pulse so the chat feels inhabited without competing with title cards.

---

## Explore hub

Route: `/explore` (AppNav / top-bar cinema icon → Explore; “Back to chat” returns home).

Explore is a **hub** with primary children:

| Child | Route | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| **Feeds (hub)** | `/explore` | Recently Added, Recent Releases, Library Pulse, On This Day rails |
| **Tags** | `/explore/tags` (+ `/tag/:name`) | Keyword facet search → tag wall |
| **Plot Lab** | `/explore/plot-lab` | Motif chips → filtered poster wall; seed search → neighbor rail |
| **Section pages** | `/explore/section/:sectionId` | Paginated drill-down for a single feed |

| Hub section | Role |
|-------------|------|
| **Recently Added** | `/api/library/feeds/recently-added` (`added_at` window) |
| **Recent Releases** | `/api/library/feeds/recent-releases` — honest empty until ISO dates enriched |
| **Library Pulse** | Compact stats from overview + health (not a second dashboard) |
| **On This Day** | `/api/library/feeds/on-this-day` (calendar mode or milestone fallback) |

Explore is browse-first; chat remains the primary curation loop. Empty rails show API `note` text (sync hasn’t recorded dates, neighbors not materialized yet) rather than inventing filler. Person pages (`/person/:id`) and title detail sit under the same AppShell chrome.

---

## Watchlist

Two surfaces, one job each:

| Surface | Job |
|---------|-----|
| **Watchlist page (`/watchlist`)** | Full media explore list — poster/title grid of merged Plex Discover + local pins, multi-select bulk toolbar (**Remove** = unpin/soft; owner-only **Delete** = typed `DELETE` confirm with **Index only** vs **Full remove**), title click opens the right-docked **TitleDetailDrawer** (with **Open full page**). Sidebar **Watchlist (N)** button and AppNav **Watchlist** both route here. |
| **Settings → Watchlist** | Sync/token only — Plex Discover pull/push toggles, enable flags, Sync now, and pull stats (`Pulled N · unresolved M`). Links to the Watchlist page; not the pin browser. |

- The Watchlist page **pull-syncs from Plex Discover** on load when a Sign-in-with-Plex account token is available, then lists local + imported pins.
- Plex Discover pull **paginates the full watchlist** (`X-Plex-Container-Start/Size`) so large watchlists import completely, not just the first page.
- Watchlist rows open **title detail** (drawer first, full page from the drawer).
- Agent tools: `query_watchlist`, `add_to_watchlist`, `remove_from_watchlist`, `curate_watchlist`, `critique_watchlist`.

---

## Owner dashboard

Owners open **Admin → Dashboard** (`/admin/dashboard`) for library intelligence (pure SVG/CSS charts — no charting library):

| Panel | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| **Composition** | Decade, top genres, movies vs shows, countries, languages, runtime distribution |
| **Health & engagement** | Unwatched %, stale adds, **rating coverage** (watched titles with reviews), curator streak |
| **Storage** | Purge candidates table — multi-select checkboxes, **Delete Selected** / **Dismiss Selected** with confirmation |
| **Taste profile** | Recent reviews / preference signals with stars on a **/5** scale |

Background **idle scheduler** tasks pre-warm health metrics, taste refresh, embeddings, anniversaries, and recommendation caches so the dashboard and chat stay responsive. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#agent-tools-vs-background-scheduler).

---

## Multi-user recommendations

When `features.multi_user_enabled` is on:

1. Any title card can **Recommend** to household peers (`RecommendModal`).
2. Recipients see an unread **RecommendationsInbox** at the top of chat home.
3. Dismiss one or dismiss-all clears the inbox items.

Local curated lists (Settings → Lists) remain separate from peer recommendations.

---

## Lens isolation UX

### User mental model

A **lens** is a taste sandbox — like separate playlists for “comfort rewatch” vs “director study.” Switching lenses (API / advanced config) changes:

- Which chat messages appear in history
- Which taste weights apply (`lens_taste_profile`)
- Which telemetry bucket receives future events (ingestion is live; cross-lens sharing remains limited)

Ambient context inference complements lenses for everyday chat; legacy lens CRUD remains available for power users.

### Default and custom lenses

- **`general`** — seeded at install; default active lens.
- **Custom lenses** — created via `POST /api/lenses` with URL-safe `lens_id`.

### Cross-contamination firewall

Watch completions and chat signals under lens A do not update taste weights for lens B unless:

- The user explicitly shares a preference across lenses (**Future**), or
- A lens has `explicit_lock = 0` and shared global preference facts apply (global `preference_facts` remain cross-lens today).

### API contract

```json
POST /api/chat
{
  "message": "Find neo-noir gaps",
  "session_id": "optional-uuid",
  "lens_id": "general",
  "persona_id": "optional-persona-template-id"
}
```

Response includes `lens_id` on the assistant message. History queries use the same filter server-side. SSE streaming (`GET /api/chat/stream`) emits `token`, `tool_call`, `done`, and `error` events for incremental UI updates.

---

## Persona tuning UX

### Conversation-level personas (1.5+)

The composer **PersonaSelector** switches persona per thread: five built-in presets (Classic Curator, Blunt Archivist, Enthusiastic Scout, Academic Critic, Night Owl Host), plus owner-shared and user-private custom personas. Threads show the active persona in the sidebar; “set as default” applies to new conversations.

### Seven personality sliders

Configured in **Admin → Persona** / persona create-edit modal and stored on persona templates:

| Slider | Field | Low (0.0) | High (1.0) |
|--------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Vocabulary | `val_bro_prof` | Casual | Professorial |
| Tone | `val_dipl_snark` | Diplomatic | Snarky |
| Autonomy | `val_pass_auto` | Passive | Autonomous |
| Depth | `val_depth` | Quick picks | Deep dives |
| Obscurity | `val_obscurity` | Mainstream | Niche |
| Verbosity | `val_verbosity` | Concise | Detailed |
| Formality | `val_formality` | Chatty | Structured |

**Curator name** updates greetings, page title, and LLM system prompt via `build_system_prompt()` — no container restart required.

Presets set welcome copy, composer hints, accent, and review prompt voice; live sync progress in the status dock always takes priority over persona job-status flavor text.

---

## Profile & preferences

Under **Settings → Profile** (when signed in):

- Display name / household identity (multi-user)
- **UI font size** — `small` / `medium` / `large` (persisted as `ui_font_size`, applied via CSS variable)
- **Theme** — Lights Up / Lights Down / Match system (also cycled from the top-bar icon)

---

## Delight features (chat home)

Shipped alongside the idle scheduler (1.6+):

| Feature | UX |
|---------|-----|
| **On This Day** | Anniversary prompts above the welcome panel |
| **Library at a Glance** | One-time post-sync summary (genres, decade range, hidden gems) |
| **Night Owl** | After evening hours, softer top-bar palette + runtime-aware tonight picks |
| **Double Feature** | Agent tool + `DoubleFeatureCard` pairing UI |
| **Surprise Me** | Dice button → `QuickPickCard` reveal |
| **Streaks** | Top-bar chip after 3+ conversations in 30 days |

---

## User journeys

### Onboarding

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Open :8788] --> Config[/config]
    Config --> Identity[Name curator]
    Config --> Infra[Verify Plex *arr LLM]
    Config --> Map[Map movie/TV libraries]
    Map --> Chat[Chat /]
    Chat --> Sync[Sync library]
    Sync --> Ready[Curate]
```

### Genre exploration

1. User chats in the workspace (ambient context or active `lens_id`).
2. Sends: "Explore neo-noir based on what I love."
3. Agent calls `explore_genre` / `search_library` with preference context.
4. Cards appear inline; user may expand the results overlay for large sets.
5. Dismissals record preference signals; adds go through confirmation flow.
6. Click a card for detail / trailer / Watch on Plex; optionally recommend to household peers.

### Gap finding, watch tonight, purge

Purge remains advisory in chat; *arr remove requires confirmation. Owners can also multi-select purge candidates on the dashboard. See agent catalog below.

---

## UI design system

Theme tokens in `frontend/src/styles.css` (`html[data-theme="lights-down|lights-up"]`):

- **AppShell** — shared hamburger AppNav + brand-consistent header on Explore, Tags, Plot Lab, tag/person/section, and title detail (chat keeps its richer workspace top bar)
- Top bar + sidebar + chat column as one composition; browse routes reuse the same amber / Fraunces / DM Sans language
- Icon-first top-bar actions (Material Symbols) with tooltips — fewer text nav chips
- Title cards with poster, reason text, optional “Why this?”, and library / Plex / recommend actions
- Title detail as a full-bleed hero composition (not a card stack), with sticky header that includes AppNav + BackLink
- Status dock anchored at the **bottom of the conversation sidebar**
- User chat bubbles use a warm-tinted background; assistant rows include AgentAvatar
- Footer Privacy / About — never compete with brand in the top bar; What’s New is optional overlay chrome, not a top-bar chip

Typography and accent colors follow persona presets where configured; avoid treating persona flavor as operational status.

---

## Agent tools

Core tools include library search and facet query (`motif` / `theme` included), **`find_similar_titles`**, **`list_relations`** / **`walk_relations`**, **`titles_by_person`**, genre exploration, gap analysis, hidden gems, watch-tonight / tonight picks, purge candidates, preference recording, Radarr/Sonarr/Seerr propose/confirm, reviews and review dialogue, watchlist and local lists, Plex collections (when enabled), anniversaries, library snapshot, double feature, and quick-pick roulette.

**Research & memory tools** back the two-scope curator memory (see below):

| Tool | Scope | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **`research_title`** / **`research_person`** / **`research_company`** | Repository | Retrieve source-cited public facts from configured official APIs (TMDB details/credits/keywords/images, Wikipedia, optional OMDb/TVDB), persisting a snapshot. Honest source gaps — not arbitrary web browsing. |
| **`compare_filmographies`** | Repository | Compare two people's TMDB filmographies by counts and shared credits only — never subjective "similarity." |
| **`recall_repo_memory`** | Repository | Read the latest snapshot + freshness + saved insights + how often an entity has come up. Consult **before** declaring a gap. |
| **`search_memory`** | Repository | Fuzzy "what do I already know about X"; returns matching entities with type/freshness to then `recall_repo_memory`. |
| **`save_repo_insight`** | Repository | Persist a durable, cited insight (`{source, ref, note}`) against a known entity — shared library knowledge, not private user facts. |
| **`remember_about_user`** / **`recall_user_memory`** | Per-user | Store/read the signed-in account's own private disclosures, goals, watch intentions, and follow-ups (fail-closed; never another account). |

Keyword routing still applies when no LLM provider is configured — same heuristics as earlier releases.

Agent tools are **synchronous and user-triggered**; long batch work (metadata enrichment, embeddings, plot neighbors, title relations, motifs/themes, taste refresh, health metrics, anniversary scan, recommendation warmup, data retention) belongs to the **background idle scheduler** with circuit-breaker quarantine. Boundary rules: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#agent-tools-vs-background-scheduler). MCP surface: [MCP.md](MCP.md).

---

## Curator memory model (1.10)

The curator has **two memory scopes**, both readable and writable, so it behaves as if it remembers rather than starting cold each turn.

**Repository memory (shared, source-cited).** Research on titles, people, and companies is persisted as append-only `memory_snapshots` under `memory_entities`, refreshed by idle `entity_memory_enrichment`. The curator reads it back with `recall_repo_memory` (latest snapshot + freshness + insights + how often it's come up) and `search_memory` (fuzzy "what do I already know about X", backed by `search_repository_memory`). Durable synthesis is saved as `memory_insights` through `save_repo_insight`, which stores citations (`{source, ref, note}`) so the claim can be repeated with provenance — there is no separate citation UI; the agent cites in prose from tool output. `memory_entity_activity` counts discussions per entity (best-effort, never fatal) so recall can flag "frequently discussed" and grooming can prioritize hot entities. Only provider-normalized, path-free payloads are ever stored; local file paths and rating keys never enter this scope.

**Per-user memory (private, fail-closed).** `user_memory_notes` hold a signed-in account's disclosures, goals, watch intentions, and follow-ups behind `UserMemoryService`, whose `_authorize` is fail-closed: a caller reads only their own notes, and the owner may review **only** Youth-flagged accounts. Adults are isolated from each other and from the owner.

**Per-turn injection.** `build_system_prompt(user_id, user_role)` injects a compact, privacy-safe "what you already know about this signed-in user" block next to the lens/preference context, plus a "resume where we left off" line drawn from `follow_up`/`watch_intention` notes. It reads only the caller's own notes, injects nothing when there is no signed-in user or no notes, and degrades silently on any error. The system and persona prompts state plainly that persistent, cited memory exists and instruct the curator to consult it **before** declaring a gap. The "no arbitrary web browsing/scraping" guardrail is retained; research is framed as durable cited retrieval with staleness-aware refresh.

### Design intent

Folded from the original curator-memory design note; these are the load-bearing invariants:

- **Two clean planes.** Durable, sanitized *media knowledge* (repository) is deliberately separated from private *partnership memory* (per-user). Repository memory is append-only research about people, companies, and titles across entity, snapshot, relation, insight, and activity records; it **never** stores Plex paths, tokens, or credentialed URLs.
- **Authorization fails closed.** A user reads only their own per-user memory. An owner may review/export another account **only** when that account carries the owner-set **Youth mode** flag (`users.is_youth`). Adult-member memory is never an owner view, and adults are isolated from each other.
- **Export ↔ purge symmetry.** Export is available to the account holder. Purge hard-deletes that user's notes and chat sessions/messages atomically; shared repository knowledge remains intact.
- **Transparent research.** Person/company research uses configured official APIs and records public, source-attributed snapshots. Filmography comparison reports only transparent overlap/counts — it does not infer subjective similarity. Idle `entity_memory_enrichment` refreshes a small batch of stale repository entities and never touches private user memory.
- **Preference migration.** `preference_facts` is migrated idempotently into `user_memory_notes`; legacy rows are retained solely as a rollback-compatibility source, and new account-scoped preference writes use the unified store.
