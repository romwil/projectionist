# CuratorX — Configuration

Settings persist to `{DATA_DIR}/settings.json` (default `/config/settings.json` in Docker, `./config` locally). Environment variables override file values when set.

### Projectionist env prefix (compat window)

Canonical branded variables use the `PROJECTIONIST_*` prefix. Matching `CURATORX_*` names are still read for ~2 releases when the new key is unset; the runtime logs a deprecation warning when a legacy key supplies the value. Prefer `PROJECTIONIST_*` on new installs and when you next edit Compose / Unraid templates.

| MCP full confirm | `PROJECTIONIST_MCP_FULL_CONFIRM` (alias `CURATORX_MCP_FULL_CONFIRM`) | Active-curation scope: `1`/`true` lets the full MCP key confirm/execute its own *arr proposals. Off by default — a human confirms on the web plane. |
| Session secret | `PROJECTIONIST_SESSION_SECRET` (alias `CURATORX_SESSION_SECRET`) | Multi-user session cookies (auto-generated under `DATA_DIR` if unset) |
| Owner username | `PROJECTIONIST_OWNER_USERNAME` (alias `CURATORX_OWNER_USERNAME`) | Username for the env-seeded owner (default `owner`) |
| Owner password | `PROJECTIONIST_OWNER_PASSWORD` (alias `CURATORX_OWNER_PASSWORD`) | Multi-user first-owner setup: seeds the owner account so the first login cannot be raced on a shared LAN. Sign in with local username + password (works even if local login is otherwise off). Rotating it and restarting resets the owner password (no lockout). Min 8 chars. |

MCP details: [MCP.md](MCP.md). Privacy disclosure: [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) and in-app `/privacy`.

### Title research sources

`research_title` is the chat tool for a specific thin or uncertain record. It
uses only configured official APIs: TMDB (key required), Wikipedia MediaWiki
(no key), OMDb (optional key), and TVDB (optional v4 key/subscription for TV).
The response names every source checked and preserves source gaps instead of
inventing details. Source readiness appears in **Admin → Connections**; keys
remain masked and are never emitted to chat or MCP clients.

---

## Feature flags (optional, off by default)

CuratorX ships as a **single-owner homelab app** with no login screen. Household multi-user auth and Seerr integration are **opt-in** and stay disabled until you turn them on in Configuration or `settings.json`.

Default values (also in `config/settings.example.json`):

```json
{
  "features": {
    "multi_user_enabled": false,
    "seerr_enabled": false
  },
  "auth": {
    "mode": "disabled",
    "plex_login_enabled": true,
    "oidc_enabled": false,
    "local_login_enabled": false
  },
  "seerr": {
    "url": "",
    "api_key": "",
    "link_on_login": true,
    "require_linked_user_for_requests": false
  }
}
```

| Flag | Default | What it does when enabled |
|------|---------|---------------------------|
| `features.multi_user_enabled` | `false` | Login + session cookie; API middleware + per-user chat/actions when on — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) |
| `features.invite_only` | `true` | When multi-user is on, new Plex/OIDC users must redeem a `/join` invite (existing users unchanged) |
| `features.open_auto_provision` | `false` | Opt-in LAN-open: auto-provision new sign-ins as members (overrides invite-only) |
| `features.plex_collections_enabled` | `false` | Let the curator propose Plex collection create/add (confirm-gated) |
| `features.ephemeral_collection_gc_enabled` | `true` | Idle prune of expired `[CuratorX]` movie-night / agent collections |
| `features.ephemeral_collection_gc_dry_run` | `false` | Log what `collection_gc` would delete without calling Plex DELETE |
| `features.seerr_enabled` | `false` | Activates Seerr connector for household discovery and requests |
| `features.live_channels_enabled` | `false` | Tunarr-backed Live Channels (Plex Live TV); owner toggle in Admin → Live Channels |
| `tunarr.url` | `""` | BYO Tunarr base URL (`http://host:8000`); API at `{url}/api` |
| `tunarr.docker_orchestration` | `false` | Allow pull/start/stop of a Tunarr sibling when a Docker socket is present |
| `tunarr.image_tag` | `chrisbenincasa/tunarr:1.3.x` | Pinned image for orchestrated installs |
| `auth.mode` | `disabled` | Set to `plex`, `oidc`, or `local` when multi-user is on |
| `seerr.link_on_login` | `true` | After Plex login, bridge identity to Seerr |
| `seerr.require_linked_user_for_requests` | `false` | Block Seerr requests until the user is linked |

**Live Channels env overrides** (optional; prefer settings UI for BYO URL):

| Env var | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `PROJECTIONIST_TUNARR_URL` | Fills `tunarr.url` when the settings file leaves it empty |
| `PROJECTIONIST_TUNARR_IMAGE` | When set, wins over `tunarr.image_tag` (deploy pin) |
| `PROJECTIONIST_DOCKER_ORCHESTRATION` | When set (`1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`), wins over `tunarr.docker_orchestration` |

**For most installs:** leave everything at the defaults. CuratorX behaves exactly as before — one implicit owner, no login, no Seerr calls.

**To enable multi-user or Seerr later:** open **Admin → Multi-user auth** and **Admin → Seerr** (or edit `{DATA_DIR}/settings.json`), set `features.multi_user_enabled` to `true`, enable one or more of `auth.plex_login_enabled`, `auth.local_login_enabled`, and `auth.oidc_enabled` (set `auth.mode` to match your primary method), and save. For Seerr, set `features.seerr_enabled` to `true`, add your Seerr URL and API key, and test the connection. The frontend reads `GET /api/features` (`auth_methods`, flags) to show or hide login options, Seerr request buttons, and user-management UI.

### Multi-user login

When `features.multi_user_enabled` is `true`, CuratorX requires sign-in for the chat UI and enforces session auth on `/api/*` (allowlisted health/features/auth/webhooks). See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

1. **Enable in Admin** — Turn on **Enable multi-user auth** and choose login methods (Plex, local password, OIDC).
2. **Set a session secret (required for any real deploy)** — Export `CURATORX_SESSION_SECRET` to a long random string in your container or `.env`. Without it, CuratorX auto-generates one under `DATA_DIR` (or refuses the public dev default for multi-user).
3. **Sign in** — Open CuratorX; you are redirected to `/login`. Use a configured method. For Plex, CuratorX opens the plex.tv link flow; after approval, CuratorX stores a signed session cookie. Token paste remains an advanced fallback only.
4. **Roles** — By default the first account to sign in becomes **owner** and later accounts start as **member**. On a shared LAN that first-login step can be raced, so for any deploy beyond a fully trusted network set `PROJECTIONIST_OWNER_PASSWORD` (and optionally `PROJECTIONIST_OWNER_USERNAME`, default `owner`) in your container/`.env`. Projectionist then seeds the owner account up front — sign in with that local username + password (works even if the local-login flag is off), and no other first login can claim owner. Rotating the password and restarting resets it (recovery path — no lockout). Owners can promote/demote, disable, or remove users under **Admin → Users**. Chat, pending actions, watchlist, recommendations, and reviews are partitioned by user.
5. **Seerr bridge** — With Seerr enabled and **Link Plex users to Seerr on login** checked, CuratorX calls Seerr `POST /auth/plex` during Plex login and stores `seerr_user_id` + permissions on the user row.
6. **OIDC** — Set `oidc_issuer_url`, `oidc_client_id`, `oidc_client_secret`, and `oidc_redirect_uri` (callback to your CuratorX URL). The authorize flow uses a CSRF `state` parameter.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /api/auth/me` | Current signed-in user (401 when multi-user is on and no session) |
| `POST /api/auth/plex/pin` | Start Plex PIN login; returns `auth_url` to open |
| `GET /api/auth/plex/pin/{id}` | Poll PIN; when authorized, upsert user and set session cookie |
| `POST /api/auth/plex` | Advanced: validate a pasted Plex auth token, upsert user, set session cookie |
| `POST /api/auth/local/register` | Owner local-password registration (when enabled) |
| `POST /api/auth/local/login` | Local password login |
| `GET /api/auth/oidc/authorize` | Start OIDC (when enabled) |
| `GET /api/auth/oidc/callback` | OIDC callback |
| `POST /api/auth/logout` | Clear session cookie |
| `GET /api/users` | List household users (owner only) |
| `PATCH /api/users/{id}` | Change role (owner only) |

**Proxy / Unraid notes**

- **Plex PIN:** No OAuth callback URL is required. The browser opens plex.tv; CuratorX polls plex.tv from the server. Allow outbound HTTPS to `plex.tv` / `app.plex.tv`.
- **OIDC:** Configure `oidc_redirect_uri` to your CuratorX callback URL (must be reachable by the IdP).
- Serve CuratorX over HTTPS (or trusted LAN HTTP) as usual for the HttpOnly session cookie (`SameSite=Lax`).

**Troubleshooting**

- **401 after enabling multi-user** — Expected until you sign in at `/login`.
- **Popup blocked** — Use the **Open Plex sign-in** link on the login page.
- **Plex sign-in never completes** — Confirm outbound access to plex.tv; retry Sign in with Plex.
- **Seerr not linked** — Confirm Seerr URL/API key, enable **Link on login**, and ensure the Plex account exists in Seerr.

---

## Library sync (Settings)

After onboarding, open **Config** / **Settings**. The **Library sync** card lets you pull your Plex libraries into CuratorX on demand.

| Control | What it does |
|---------|----------------|
| **Sync library** | Starts a background job (`POST /api/library/sync`) |
| Movie/show counts | From `GET /api/library/stats` — how many titles are indexed |
| Last sync | When the most recent sync finished (or "Never" if you have not synced yet) |
| Status line | Polls `/api/jobs` every few seconds while a sync is running |

**When to use it:** after adding new movies or shows in Plex, when title cards look stale, or when `/stats` in chat shows an old last-sync time. Automatic sync also runs on a schedule (`library_sync_interval_hours`, default 24 h). Optionally set `library_sync_hour` (0–23) so daily sync prefers a clock hour in the container’s local timezone (`TZ` env) instead of firing purely on elapsed time after the last run.

**If sync fails:** check Plex server URL / server token and library section keys in Config, then read container logs (`docker compose logs -f curatorx`). The status line shows the error when the job fails. After a container restart, start sync again — phase checkpoints resume unfinished work when still valid (≤72h).

### Library health dashboard

Settings includes a **Library health** section with three at-a-glance metrics from `GET /api/library/health`:

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Unwatched %** | Share of indexed titles with zero plays |
| **Stale adds** | Titles added 90+ days ago that you still have not watched |
| **Rating coverage** | Share of watched titles that have a personal 1–5 star review |

Use these to spot backlog, forgotten imports, and gaps in your review log before asking the curator for purge or rating suggestions.

### Export taste data

Owners can download a JSON backup of taste-training data from **Settings → Export taste data** (`GET /api/admin/export/training-corpus`). The file includes:

- `message_feedback` — helpful / not-helpful reactions on curator replies
- `preference_facts` — explicit and inferred taste signals
- `user_title_reviews` — your personal star ratings and notes

Use this for offline analysis, backup, or feeding external training pipelines. Nothing is uploaded automatically.

---

## Seerr (optional household requests)

Seerr (Overseerr / Jellyseerr) lets household **members** request movies and shows without direct Radarr/Sonarr access. CuratorX remains the **owner's intelligence layer**; members see **Request in Seerr** on title cards when multi-user mode is enabled.

### Setup steps (novice homelab)

1. **Install Seerr** — Deploy [Seerr](https://github.com/seerr-team/seerr) on your LAN alongside Plex, Radarr, and Sonarr. Complete its setup wizard and link Plex + *arr inside Seerr.
2. **Create an API key** — In Seerr: **Settings → General → API Key**. Copy the key.
3. **Enable in CuratorX** — **Config → Seerr** → check **Enable Seerr integration**, enter URL (e.g. `http://10.0.0.10:5055`) and API key, click **Test connection**.
4. **Certify** — A successful test marks Seerr certified (same as Plex/Radarr). Save settings.
5. **Roles** — Owners keep **Add to Radarr/Sonarr**. Members (when multi-user is on) get **Request in Seerr**. Check `GET /api/features` → `request_path` (`arr` or `seerr`).

### API endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /api/features` | `request_path`, `user.role`, Seerr flags |
| `GET /api/requests` | Proxy to Seerr pending request queue |
| `POST /api/setup/test/seerr` | Validate URL + API key |
| Agent `request_via_seerr` | Queue a title (confirmation optional) |
| Agent `approve_seerr_request` | Owner approves a pending request |

### Troubleshooting

- **401 on test** — Regenerate the Seerr API key and save again in Config.
- **Connection refused** — Verify the URL from the CuratorX host/container (not just your desktop browser).
- **Members still see Radarr** — Requires `features.seerr_enabled` **and** `user.role` = `member` from `GET /api/features`.
- **Request fails after confirm** — Ensure Radarr/Sonarr are configured in Seerr and the service API key has admin/request rights.

## Plex review sync

CuratorX can mirror your **personal 1–5 star reviews** back to Plex so they appear as Plex user ratings on movies and shows you own.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `sync_reviews_to_plex` | `true` | When enabled, every saved review with a Plex `rating_key` triggers `PUT /:/rate` |

**Star mapping:** CuratorX uses 0.5–5 stars internally (half-star steps). Plex stores ratings on a 0–10 scale, so CuratorX maps `stars × 2` (e.g. `4.5→9`, `5→10`).

**Where to turn it on:** Configuration → **Plex library mapping** → check **Sync personal reviews to Plex star ratings**, then save (the toggle saves immediately).

**Requirements:** Plex URL and token must be configured. The reviewed title needs a Plex `rating_key` (usually present after a library sync). If sync fails (Plex offline, missing key), the review is still saved locally; `plex_rating_synced` stays `false` until a later save succeeds.

**Reading Plex ratings:** During library sync, CuratorX reads each title's Plex `userRating` (0–10 scale) and stores it as `plex_user_rating_stars` (1–5) on `library_items`. Episode-level Plex ratings are stored on `library_episodes.plex_user_rating_stars` during TV episode sync.

**Immediate cache update:** When a review syncs to Plex (including after you choose **Replace on Plex**), CuratorX updates the local `plex_user_rating_stars` cache immediately — you do not need to wait for the next library sync to see the new rating in chat or library queries.

**Rating conflicts:** If Plex already has a different star rating when you save a review with sync enabled, the API returns **409** with `code: plex_rating_conflict` and the message `Plex has X★ — keep or replace?`. Your review is saved locally either way. Choose **Keep Plex rating** to leave Plex unchanged, or **Replace on Plex** (resubmit with `replace_plex_rating: true`) to overwrite Plex.

**Collections (curator tools):** The agent can propose creating Plex collections or adding owned titles to an existing collection when `features.plex_collections_enabled` is `true`. These writes require the same confirmation tokens as Radarr/Sonarr adds — nothing is sent to Plex until you confirm in chat. Turn this on in Configuration → **Plex library mapping** → **Allow curator to manage Plex collections**.

Agent / movie-night collections are tagged with a `[CuratorX]` title prefix and recorded with a TTL (`ephemeral_collection_ttl_hours`, default 168). Idle task `collection_gc` deletes only those tracked rows when expired — never owner-named evergreen collections without the marker. Owner toggles: `features.ephemeral_collection_gc_enabled` (default true) and `features.ephemeral_collection_gc_dry_run` (log-only).

---

## Plex webhooks (near-completion rating prompts)

CuratorX can receive **Plex webhook** events so rating prompts appear soon after you finish a movie or episode — without waiting for the next library sync.

### Webhook URL

Point Plex at this endpoint (replace host/port with your CuratorX server):

```text
http://YOUR_CURATORX_HOST:8765/api/webhooks/plex
```

Examples:

| How you run CuratorX | Typical URL |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Docker on Unraid (`8765:8765`) | `http://YOUR_UNRAID_IP:8765/api/webhooks/plex` |
| Same machine as Plex | `http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/webhooks/plex` |
| Reverse proxy | `https://curatorx.yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/plex` |

Plex must be able to reach this URL from the Plex Media Server host (LAN IP is fine; `localhost` only works if Plex and CuratorX share the same container/network namespace).

### Webhook authentication (optional)

If your CuratorX instance is reachable from outside your trusted LAN, set a shared secret so random callers cannot queue rating prompts.

| Setting | Env var | Header |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `webhook_secret` | `PROJECTIONIST_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (alias `CURATORX_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) | `X-Projectionist-Webhook-Secret` (or legacy `X-CuratorX-Webhook-Secret`) |

When `webhook_secret` is non-empty, every `POST /api/webhooks/plex` must include the header with the same value. Requests without a matching header receive **401 Unauthorized**. When the secret is empty (default), webhooks work as before with no header required.

**Homelab tip:** Generate a long random string (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`), add it to `.env` as `CURATORX_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...`, restart CuratorX, then configure your reverse proxy or a small script to inject the header when forwarding Plex webhooks — Plex itself does not send custom headers, so the secret is most useful behind a proxy you control or on a LAN-only URL.

### Setup steps (novice homelab / Unraid)

1. **Confirm CuratorX is reachable** — Open the CuratorX UI in your browser. Note the host IP and port (default **8765** in `docker-compose.yml`).
2. **Open Plex webhook settings** — Plex Web App → your avatar → **Account Settings** → **Webhooks** (or Plex Media Server → **Settings** → **Webhooks**, depending on Plex version).
3. **Add the URL** — Paste `http://YOUR_CURATORX_IP:8765/api/webhooks/plex` and save.
4. **Test with a short watch** — Play a movie or episode past **85%**, then stop playback. Within a few seconds, open CuratorX chat; a persona-voiced rating card should appear at the bottom of the thread.
5. **Optional: Tautulli** — If you use Tautulli, configure it under **Config → Tautulli**. Library sync will also use Tautulli `get_metadata` for completion % when Plex `viewOffset` is missing locally.

### What CuratorX listens for

| Plex event | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| `media.stop` | If `viewOffset / duration ≥ 85%`, queue a rating prompt |
| `media.scrobble` | Plex marks a title watched (~90%+); queue a rating prompt |
| `media.pause` | Same completion check as stop (useful on some clients) |

Prompts are skipped when you already saved a review, or if you dismissed the same title within the last 30 days.

**Personal watch nudges need a mapped Plex identity.** CuratorX only queues “You’re X% through…” prompts when the webhook `Account.id` matches a CuratorX user with that Plex id linked (Admin → Access / household users). Unmapped or server-token watches are ignored on purpose so one person’s progress never becomes another account’s nudge.

### Troubleshooting

- **No prompt after finishing** — Confirm the webhook URL is saved in Plex and CuratorX logs show `Plex webhook` entries. Try a full stop (not just back-button) past 85%. If logs show `unattributed_account`, link that Plex user under Admin → Access so personal nudges can bind.
- **Connection refused** — Use the LAN IP CuratorX listens on, not `localhost`, unless Plex runs on the same host.
- **Prompt only after sync** — Webhook not reaching CuratorX; fix URL/firewall. Sync-based detection still works via `viewOffset` during library sync.
- **Duplicate prompts** — One row per `(user_id, rating_key)` in `rating_prompt_queue`; re-watching updates completion but won't spam if you already reviewed.

---

## Logging

CuratorX logs to **stdout/stderr** for Docker and systemd deployments. Set the level in `.env` or `docker-compose.yml`:

| Level | What you see |
|-------|----------------|
| **ERROR** | Failures only (sync crashes, tool errors, HTTP hard failures) |
| **WARNING** | HTTP errors/timeouts, episode sync skips, LLM chat errors, invalid settings |
| **INFO** | Startup, sync start/finish, scheduler triggers, action propose/confirm, phase counts |
| **DEBUG** | Per-job progress, TMDB/Fanart enrichment skips, agent tool calls, env/settings merge |

Examples:

```bash
# Follow live logs
docker compose logs -f curatorx

# Verbose troubleshooting
CURATORX_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG docker compose up -d

# Errors only
CURATORX_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR docker compose up -d
```

API keys and tokens are never written to logs (URLs and error bodies are redacted).

### Data retention (idle task)

`data_retention` prunes accumulating tables once per day. Defaults (override via matching attributes on settings if present):

| Setting key | Default | Table |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| `telemetry_retention_days` | 90 | `system_telemetry_stream` |
| `interaction_retention_days` | 90 | `interaction_telemetry` |
| `anniversary_retention_days` | 30 | `daily_anniversaries` |
| `task_run_retention_days` | 60 | `scheduled_task_runs` (durable scheduler history) |

### Scheduled tasks (owner Admin)

| Control | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| Cadence (`run_interval_seconds`) | Owner presets / custom hours; auto-tune may nudge within caps for trickle tasks |
| Batch (`items_per_cycle`) | Persisted for metadata / embeddings / neighbors / LLM logline / long synopsis; auto-tune adjusts after successful runs |
| History / rate | `GET …/history`, `GET …/rate`; list payload includes measured items/hour when history exists |

### Long synopsis (owner)

Idle task `long_synopsis_enrichment` fills nullable `library_items.long_synopsis` + `synopsis_source` from Wikipedia (no key) or OMDb (key).

**Why Wikipedia is the default:** it is free, needs no API key, and adds deeper plot text without spending LLM tokens. Fresh installs and settings files that omit the key use `wikipedia`. If you previously saved an explicit empty string, that stays disabled (same as `off`).

```json
{
  "long_synopsis_source": "wikipedia",
  "omdb_api_key": ""
}
```

Disable with preferred value `off` (also `none` / `disabled` / empty):

```json
{ "long_synopsis_source": "off" }
```

Or env: `CURATORX_LONG_SYNOPSIS_SOURCE=wikipedia` / `off` / `auto` / `omdb` and optional `OMDB_API_KEY=…`. Themes do not need keys — `keyword_theme_tagging` maps TMDB keywords already in the DB.

### First-start idle bootstrap

On IdleScheduler start, if foundational knowledge tasks have **never run** (`last_run_at` null), CuratorX runs a one-shot sequenced bootstrap instead of waiting for multi-day intervals:

1. `metadata_enrichment` (only if metadata backlog > 0)
2. `summary_motifs`
3. `keyword_theme_tagging`
4. `long_synopsis_enrichment` (only if source is enabled — Wikipedia by default)
5. `semantic_embeddings` (only if zero embeddings exist and titles still need them)

Tasks run **one after another** (not in parallel). Progress is stored under `idle_bootstrap_queue` / `idle_bootstrap_completed` in `curator_system_config` so restarts resume once and do not loop forever. Logs look like `bootstrap: running summary_motifs because never run` (history trigger=`bootstrap`). Existing installs where those tasks already ran mark completed immediately with nothing to do.

## LLM providers

| Provider | Default base URL | Notes |

## Curator persona (database-backed)

Persona settings live in SQLite (`curator_persona_metrics`), not only `settings.json`:

| Field | API | Description |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| Curator name | `PUT /api/persona` | Display name; injected into system prompt |
| Vocabulary density | `val_bro_prof` | 0.0 (bro) → 1.0 (professorial) |
| Interaction friction | `val_dipl_snark` | 0.0 (diplomatic) → 1.0 (snarky) |
| Automation autonomy | `val_pass_auto` | 0.0 (passive) → 1.0 (autonomous) |

Curator name can also be stored in `curator_system_config` via `PUT /api/system-config`.

## Curation lenses

| Concept | Storage | API |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Active lens | `curator_system_config.active_lens_id` | `GET/PUT /api/lenses/active` |
| Lens registry | `curation_lenses` table | `GET/POST /api/lenses` |
| Taste weights | `lens_taste_profile` | Per-lens cluster tags with optional explicit lock |
| Chat scope | `lens_id` on sessions/messages | Pass `lens_id` on `POST /api/chat` |

Default lens: **`general`**.

## Secrets handling

API keys are stored in `settings.json` on the config volume when saved via the UI. Environment variables (including values from `.env` when running locally or via Docker `env_file`) override file values at runtime and are **not** written back unless you explicitly save a new value in Settings.

`GET /api/settings` masks secret fields and returns `{field}_set: true` plus `{field}_source` (`env` or `file`) instead of raw values. The config UI shows placeholders such as “Configured via environment (.env)” for env-backed secrets.

Local dev: copy `.env.example` to `.env` — the web app loads it on startup (`load_dotenv_file`). Docker Compose also passes `.env` via `env_file`.
