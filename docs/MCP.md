# CuratorX MCP

CuratorX exposes a Model Context Protocol server over your indexed Plex library, with **two trust planes** selected by which API key you present.

Repository memory is shared, sanitized media knowledge and may be added to the
read-only MCP surface. Private user memory, account exports, and user-memory
events are never exposed through either MCP trust plane.

## Why MCP for media curation?

A personal Plex library is a uniquely well-structured local dataset: thousands of titles with rich metadata (genres, ratings, cast, watch state, file sizes) already indexed in SQLite. MCP lets an LLM reach into that index with surgical precision — one tool call per conversational turn — without ever bulk-exporting your collection or exposing your Plex token to a remote service.

> "The LLM gets to act like a natural language surgeon on a highly optimized, predictable local dataset. It's incredibly fast, it's cheap, and it keeps your Plex token and personal collection server info locked down."

CuratorX demonstrates this pattern as a **production-quality, privacy-first MCP interface** over local structured + unstructured data:

- **Fast** — tool calls hit a pre-built SQLite index and NumPy vectors; sub-second responses even on modest homelab hardware.
- **Cheap** — the LLM receives only the minimal context slice for each turn, keeping token costs low.
- **Private** — credentials, watch history, and internal fields stay on your hardware. Dual keys let you share a read-only library view externally while keeping *arr mutations and internal fields behind a separate trust boundary.

## Install

```bash
pip install "curatorx[mcp]"
# or in the Docker image: already included
```

## Modes

| Mode | How selected | Response schema | Tool surface |
|------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **privacy** (default for sharing) | HTTP: `CURATORX_MCP_API_KEY`. Stdio: `CURATORX_MCP_MODE=privacy` (or unset). | Public content — titles/metadata; **no** `rating_key`, file sizes, raw watch timestamps, `in_radarr`/`in_sonarr`, or tokenized Plex thumbs. Optional `watch_state` enum. | Read-only library tools |
| **full** (trusted in-stack) | HTTP: `CURATORX_MCP_FULL_API_KEY`. Stdio: `CURATORX_MCP_MODE=full` **and** distinct full key in env. | Internal fields allowed (`rating_key`, view counts, *arr flags, file size) but **never** live `X-Plex-Token` in URLs. | Read tools **plus** confirm-gated `propose_add_radarr` / `propose_add_sonarr` / `propose_remove_arr` / `confirm_pending_action` |

**Rules**

- Mode comes from the **key** (HTTP) or stdio mode + full-key presence — never from a client “mode” query param.
- Privacy and full keys must **differ**. If they are equal or the full key is empty, full mode is refused.
- If only one key is configured, that key’s mode applies.

## Images (TMDB CDN)

Emitted `poster_url` / `backdrop_url` are allowlisted to `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/{size}/…` only. Defaults are usually fine; power users can set sizes via `settings.json` or `PUT /api/settings` (not shown on Admin → Advanced):

- `mcp_tmdb_poster_size` (default `w500`; allow `w185` / `w342` / `w500` / `w780`)
- `mcp_tmdb_backdrop_size` (default `w1280`; allow `w300` / `w780` / `w1280` / `original`)

Plex/Fanart thumbs (including any URL containing `X-Plex-Token`) are cleared rather than rewritten.

## Admin → Advanced (operators)

Owners can **generate / regenerate** privacy and full MCP keys, see a last-4 hint (never the full secret on list GETs), and copy a newly generated key once. Keys persist to `settings.json` (file overrides empty-or-absent env after rotate). Unraid templates also expose both env vars.

| Env / setting | Mode |
|---------------|------|
| `CURATORX_MCP_API_KEY` / `mcp_api_key` | Privacy |
| `CURATORX_MCP_FULL_API_KEY` / `mcp_full_api_key` | Full (must differ) |

## Stdio (Cursor / Claude Desktop)

```bash
DATA_DIR=/path/to/config curatorx-mcp
# equivalent: python -m curatorx.mcp
```

Privacy (default):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "curatorx": {
      "command": "curatorx-mcp",
      "env": {
        "DATA_DIR": "/mnt/user/appdata/curatorx/config",
        "CURATORX_MCP_MODE": "privacy"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Full (trusted LAN automation only):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "curatorx-full": {
      "command": "curatorx-mcp",
      "env": {
        "DATA_DIR": "/mnt/user/appdata/curatorx/config",
        "CURATORX_MCP_MODE": "full",
        "CURATORX_MCP_FULL_API_KEY": "generate-a-long-random-secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Repo sample: [`mcp.json`](../mcp.json).

## HTTP transport

Mounts at `/mcp` when at least one of `CURATORX_MCP_API_KEY` / `CURATORX_MCP_FULL_API_KEY` is set.

```bash
# Privacy mode
curl -H "X-CuratorX-MCP-Key: $CURATORX_MCP_API_KEY" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8788/mcp

# Full mode
curl -H "X-CuratorX-MCP-Key: $CURATORX_MCP_FULL_API_KEY" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8788/mcp
```

Without either key, `/mcp` returns **503**. Wrong key → **401**. Logs record `mode=` only — never the key material.

## Tools

### Read (both modes)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `library_query` / `library_aggregate` / facets / TV helpers | Browse owned inventory |
| `library_overview_tool` / `library_title_detail` | Compact stats + title detail |
| `what_to_watch_tonight` | Owned watch suggestions |
| `find_collection_gaps` / `recommend_hidden_gems` | Gap / gem style browses |
| `suggest_purge_candidates_tool` | Purge candidates |
| `analyze_watch_patterns` | Overview + in-progress TV |
| `list_watchlist_pins` | Watchlist snapshot |
| `upcoming_premieres` | Recently added titles |
| `search_tmdb_proxy` | TMDB search when key configured (CDN posters; trimmed fields) |

The in-app agent’s `research_title` service combines configured TMDB details
with the keyless Wikipedia MediaWiki API and optional OMDb/TVDB sources. It
returns provenance and does not expose Plex paths or credentials. A future
read-only MCP `research_title` tool should wrap this same sanitized service;
the in-process agent surface ships first so external-provider behavior and
privacy boundaries remain centrally tested.

Chat agent tools (same library index; available in the in-app curator and mirrored concepts for MCP library browses) also include graph/person helpers. Prefer these when the user asks “more like X”, “same director”, or “franchise siblings”:

| Agent tool | Purpose | Cache / source |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| `find_similar_titles` | Similar or surprising neighbors for a seed | `item_neighbors` (`mode=similar\|surprising`) |
| `list_relations` | One-hop `title_relations` edges | collection / neighbor / shared_crew / llm_theme |
| `walk_relations` | Shallow BFS (depth ≤ 2) over relations | same graph |
| `titles_by_person` | In-library filmography for a person | `people` + `credits` |
| `get_facet_catalog` | Top facet values including **`motif`** and **`theme`** | `library_facets` |

Empty neighbor/relation results mean the idle scheduler has not materialized the cache yet — not that the library is empty. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#agent-tools-vs-background-scheduler).

### Full mode only (*arr — propose → confirm)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `propose_add_radarr` / `propose_add_sonarr` | Queue add; returns `pending_token` |
| `propose_remove_arr` | Queue remove; returns `pending_token` |
| `confirm_pending_action` | Cancel a pending token, or confirm/execute it **when the key is scoped for active curation** |

Privacy mode callers receive an error if they invoke propose/confirm tools. There is no silent `require_confirmation=false` path.

**Active-curation scope (H3).** A full key can always *propose* and *cancel*. Whether it may *confirm/execute* its own proposals is a scope bound to key issuance: set `mcp_full_confirm_enabled` (Admin → rotate the full key with the active-curation scope) or `CURATORX_MCP_FULL_CONFIRM=1` for stdio / Unraid CA. Without the scope, `confirm_pending_action` returns `requires_human_confirmation` and the pending token survives so a human can confirm it in the web UI status dock (or `POST /api/actions/confirm`). This lets you issue read+propose keys for untrusted models and reserve self-confirming keys for trusted in-stack automation.
