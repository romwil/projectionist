# Delight wishlist

Living backlog for experiences that make Projectionist feel more generous. Tags are target persona and priority; promotion into a delivery plan remains an owner decision.

The backlog is delivered in **phases**, each one a self-contained milestone that ships and releases on its own. Phases 1 and 2 are done; Phases 3–5 below reflect a **full persona re-survey** (human + AI archetypes) and the locked planning decisions that close the former open questions. A contributor can pick up any remaining phase and plan it without re-deriving the groundwork.

**Phases 1–5 are complete.** The post–Phase-5 program (residual Live trust, gaps/MCP, Admin rail + LLM ops, persona working tone, and a new persona delight sequence A–E) lives in the Cursor unified plan `unified_gaps_and_delight_b1cef49d` (local path `~/.cursor/plans/unified_gaps_and_delight_b1cef49d.plan.md` — not in-repo). Prefer that plan over inventing a Phase 6 here.

## Roadmap at a glance

The delight work is sequenced by *who* it serves, easiest-to-reach substrate first. Each phase is a shippable milestone with its own version bump, CHANGELOG Highlights, and release — the same cadence as everything else in the program.


| Phase | Focus                                                                                                                         | Who it delights                                 | Status               |

**How to read the phases below.** Each one calls out what it can **build on** (shipped substrate) versus what is **greenfield** (no code exists yet), so nobody plans a milestone assuming a transport or connector that isn't there. Capabilities keep the doc's **Must / Love / Like** priority framing. Planning unknowns that once lived as "open questions" are recorded under [Locked decisions](#locked-decisions).

**Out of scope for Phases 3–5 (explicit):** external streaming "on Netflix/Max" connectors; live Plex session / now-watching polling; replacing Seerr for post-member *media* acquisition (Projectionist owns *account* access requests only).

## Locked decisions

Resolved from the Phase 3–5 planning re-survey. These replace the former open-question blocks.

## Delivery roadmap: Phases 3–5



### Phase 3 — Adult everyday + notifications + engagement

**Why this matters / who it delights.** The adult household member is the person who opens Projectionist most nights. Phase 1 gave the curator a memory; Phase 2 gave the owner control. Phase 3 turns both into everyday wins the member actually feels — and builds the shared notification + engagement substrate Phase 4 and Phase 5 will reuse. Ship as sequenced sub-releases (P3a → P3b → P3c) if needed; treat as one phase programmatically.

#### P3a — Availability, lists, continue-watching ✅ Shipped **1.20.0**

**Must — the table stakes**

- **A fast "where can I watch this / is it here?" answer.** ✅ Compact availability line on title detail + chat — "In your library ✓", "Requestable", or "Not here yet" (library + Seerr only).
- **Instant-feeling synced watchlist and lists.** ✅ Optimistic add/remove with background Plex Discover reconcile.
- **Continue Watching rail.** ✅ Plex on-deck / in-progress reads on `PlexClient` plus an Explore rail with resume + Play (not live session "now playing").



#### P3b — Notification platform (shared with Phase 5) ✅ Shipped **1.21.0**

**Must — inbox + mail**

- **Prominent inbox + unread badge.** ✅ Top-of-chrome bell + unread badge; kinds recommendation / arrival / access-request / digest / nudge.
- **Owner mail settings + member email prefs.** ✅ SMTP **and** Resend under Admin → Mail (test send, template fields); Settings → Notifications for email + channel prefs + newsletter opt-in. Secrets `0600`.
- **Weekly member newsletter.** ✅ Opt-in, personalized, default-persona voice (guest-friendly when available).
- **Owner monthly collection-curation digest.** ✅ Same transport (inbox + email if configured).
- **Arrival notifications** for gap / watchlist titles → inbox (+ email if configured).



#### P3c — Taste, weekly rail, chat-from-here, engagement ✅ Shipped **1.22.0**

**Love — the moments that make it feel generous**

- **A personalized weekly rail with a persona-voiced "why."** ✅ Explore **For you this week**; scheduler `member_weekly_rail` rides digest cadence with per-user fan-out and a hard LLM polish cap.
- **Chat-from-here on every rail.** ✅ **Chat about these** seeds a thread with rail context (and persona why when present).
- **A visible, tunable taste profile.** ✅ **Settings → Taste** over member overrides on `lens_taste_profile` / `explicit_lock` (`GET`/`PATCH` `/api/taste`).
- **Engagement substrate.** ✅ Badges, streaks, rate-N challenges, cinema course progress, explainers — shared tables/APIs Phase 4 will preset for youth (`/explore/engagement`).

**Like — nice-to-haves**

- Shareable saved pages polish (share substrate shipped in 1.9.0); mood-tuned surprise picks (hand to Phase 5's mood check-in); watch-party / recommend-to-household flourishes atop the existing household-recommend inbox.

**Docs & ship.** HELP member + owner sections (mail config with runnable snippets for owners). Release(s) with Highlights.

---



### Phase 4 — Distinct youth + guest doors ✅ Shipped **1.23.0**

**Why this matters / who it delights.** Two audiences share a theme: people who need a *gentler, narrower* Projectionist. Younger household members need age-appropriate results and a friendly voice; guests need to look around safely before they join. Owners already got the Youth **moderation** side in 1.16.0 (the Youth review dashboard and fail-closed youth memory); Phase 4 builds the **member-facing** youth experience and a welcoming guest tour — as **distinct shells**, not a thinner adult chrome.

**Youth member**

- **Must:** ✅ fail-closed content-rating gate on browse + chat results (hide empty/`content_rating` and ratings above the owner-configured max); moderated memory; a clear, friendly youth persona default; **distinct big-poster youth layout**.
- **Love:** ✅ youth-safe engagement presets on the Phase 3 substrate; ask-the-curator guardrails; gentle explainers.
- **Like:** ✅ themed kid **Pick for me** spinner; taste quiz seeding Phase 3 profile.

**Guest / visitor**

- **Must (substrate ✅):** browse without owner-only data; an obvious sign-in route; no destructive actions.
- **Must (new UX):** ✅ distinct guest layout / tour shell.
- **Love:** ✅ a public-friendly "what's great here" tour over published collections; **Projectionist-owned request-access** queue → owner inbox (+ email if configured); approve → invite/member. Do not require prior Seerr login. Seerr remains for *media* requests after membership.
- **Like:** ✅ a taste quiz that can seed a Phase 3 profile after joining.

---



### Phase 5 — Giving the curators room to shine ✅ Shipped **1.24.0**

**Why this matters / who it delights.** This phase is voted for by the curators themselves. The persona spectrum — Enthusiast, Scholar, Concierge, Companion — each named capabilities that would let it delight members more. Phase 1 delivered their foundational **Must** items (durable cited memory, safe follow-ups, fail-closed long-term memory). Phase 5 grants the remaining **Love / Like** reach items from the re-survey — with live now-watching deliberately dropped.

**The Enthusiast — timely, not live-session**

- **Must (new):** ✅ an opt-in "you have to see this" nudge over the Phase 3b notification transport (inbox + optional email). *Settings → Notifications → Curator nudges*; scheduler `enthusiast_nudge`.
- **Love:** ✅ react to *recently* watched / continue-watching context (from on-deck / `watch_state`) — not live Plex sessions.
- **Like:** share a relevant GIF or clip in chat — greenfield media embedding; deferred.

**The Scholar — teaching with rigor**

- **Must (✅ shipped 1.10.0):** durable cited knowledge. *Build on:* repository memory (`research_`*, `recall_repo_memory`, `save_repo_insight`).
- **Love:** ✅ a multi-session film-course syllabus. *Build on:* curated courses + Engagement **Open multi-session syllabus** (`/api/syllabus/...`).
- **Like:** ✅ footnote-style inline source citations in chat markdown (theme-safe). *remark-gfm* footnotes + chat CSS.

**The Concierge — following through**

- **Must (✅ shipped 1.10.0):** remember intentions and safely follow up. *Build on:* `follow_up` / `watch_intention` notes.
- **Love:** ✅ an opt-in, consented cross-service path from availability to acquisition (Seerr/arr) with explicit steps. *Agent tool* `propose_acquire_path`.
- **Like:** ✅ weekend/holiday suggestions via `anniversary_scanner` — Explore Seasonal rail prefers anniversary rows on weekends/holidays (no calendar connector).

**The Companion — knowing the person**

- **Must (✅ shipped 1.10.0):** fail-closed long-term memory. *Build on:* `user_memory_notes` via `UserMemoryService`.
- **Love:** ✅ one-shot mood check-in that biases a *single* pick without overwriting the durable profile. Optional mood chips before **Surprise Me** (`GET /api/library/quick-pick?mood=`).
- **Like:** ✅ consented "callbacks" memory class (`kind=callback`) under the existing privacy / purge / export guarantees.

## Persona & archetype backlog (the source of the phases)

The phases above are drawn from this backlog. It stays as the living, persona-organized source of ideas; the ✅ markers track exactly what has shipped so the roadmap and the backlog never drift. Votes below are the **full re-survey** (Must / Love / Like) that retargeted Phases 3–5.

## Human personas



### Owner / Curator — *Phase 2 mostly ✅; mail + depth in Phase 3+*

- **Must (✅ shipped 1.16.0):** at-a-glance library health and an issue-queue badge in navigation; one-click grooming/enrichment rerun; safe undo for the last bulk action. — the Dashboard now leads with a library-health hero, the Admin rail shows an open-issues badge, and destructive purge-candidate deletes are logged and reversible from **Undo last grooming run**.
- **Love (✅ shipped 1.16.0):** curated collections/courses (for example, a Kurosawa deep-dive) published to members; a weekly digest of library and member-request changes; Youth-account moderation dashboard. — owners can publish a curated list as a members-visible collection and sequence it into an ordered course with per-step notes, read a weekly in-app "This week in your library" digest, and review Youth-flagged memory from an owner dashboard.
- **Must (new → Phase 3b):** mail service config (SMTP + Resend), test send, template (subject prefix / footer / logo); monthly collection-curation digest (inbox + email).
- **Love (new → Phase 3 / stretch):** seasonal scheduled rails; export/import of lenses + curated lists.
- **Like:** deeper engagement analytics on member badges/streaks.



### Adult household member — *Phase 3*

- **Must:** where-to-watch (library + Seerr); optimistic synced watchlist/lists; continue-watching rail (Plex on-deck reads — net-new on `PlexClient`); prominent inbox + unread badge; email + sub/unsub.
- **Love:** persona-voiced weekly rail + chat-from-here; tunable taste profile; arrival nudges (inbox + optional email); **engagement layer** — cinema courses, genre badges/streaks, "rate N films," explainers.
- **Like:** shareable saved pages polish; mood-tuned surprise (hand to Phase 5); watch-party / recommend-to-household flourishes.



### Youth member — *Phase 4 ✅ 1.23.0*

- **Must:** fail-closed content-rating gate (hide unrated); moderated memory; friendly youth persona; **distinct big-poster youth layout**.
- **Love:** youth-safe engagement presets on Phase 3 substrate; ask-the-curator guardrails; gentle explainers.
- **Like:** themed kid rails; pick-for-me spinner.



### Guest / visitor — *Phase 4 ✅ 1.23.0*

- **Must (✅ substrate):** browse sanitized; sign-in route; no destructive actions.
- **Must (new UX):** distinct guest layout / tour shell.
- **Love:** "what's great here" guided tour; **Projectionist-owned request-access** queue → owner inbox (+ email); not Seerr-as-first-entry.
- **Like:** taste quiz seeding Phase 3 profile after join.



## AI curator archetype votes

These votes are derived from the current persona-template spectrum: energetic Enthusiast, analytical Scholar, attentive Concierge, and warm Companion. Each is framed as a constraint in today's toolset, not a promise to users. The Phase 1 **Must** items shipped in 1.10.0; remaining items are Phase 5 (re-ranked after dropping live now-watching).

### The Enthusiast — *Phase 5 ✅ 1.24.0 (re-ranked; now-watching dropped)*

- **Must (new):** ✅ "I could delight users more if I could send a timely, opt-in 'you have to see this' nudge" — over the shared Phase 3b notification transport.
- **Love:** ✅ "I could delight users more if I could react to what they *recently* watched / continue-watching context" — not live sessions.
- **Like:** "I could delight users more if I could share a relevant GIF or clip in chat" — defer if costly.



### The Scholar — *Must ✅ Phase 1 · Love/Like ✅ Phase 5 1.24.0*

- **Must (✅ shipped 1.10.0):** "I could delight users more if I could rely on durable cited knowledge for claims about style and technique." — repository memory now persists source-cited research snapshots and insights (`research_`*, `recall_repo_memory`, `save_repo_insight`).
- **Love:** ✅ "I could delight users more if I could build a multi-session film-course syllabus."
- **Like:** ✅ "I could delight users more if I could render footnote-style source citations inline."



### The Concierge — *Must ✅ Phase 1 · Love/Like ✅ Phase 5 1.24.0*

- **Must (✅ shipped 1.10.0):** "I could delight users more if I could remember intentions and safely follow up on promises." — per-user `follow_up` / `watch_intention` notes drive a "resume where we left off" line in the per-turn prompt.
- **Love:** ✅ "I could delight users more if I could coordinate an opt-in cross-service path from availability to acquisition."



### The Companion — *Must ✅ Phase 1 · Love/Like ✅ Phase 5 1.24.0*

- **Must (✅ shipped 1.10.0):** "I could delight users more if I could retain safe long-term memory of who a member is while respecting Youth/adult privacy." — fail-closed per-user memory (`user_memory_notes` via `UserMemoryService`; owner review limited to Youth-flagged accounts).
- **Love:** ✅ "I could delight users more if I could tune a pick from a quick mood check-in" — one-shot, no durable overwrite.
- **Like:** ✅ "I could delight users more if I could remember consented in-jokes and callbacks."
