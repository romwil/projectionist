 * watched state (guests are excluded while multi-user is on, mirroring the
 * title-detail toggle). External / TMDB-only discovery cards never get it.
 *
 * The label toggles on the card's current watch progress: a watched title
 * offers "Mark as unwatched" (Plex `/:/unscrobble`), everything else offers
 * "Mark as watched" (Plex `/:/scrobble`).
